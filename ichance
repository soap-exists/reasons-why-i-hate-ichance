if u respect the fact that i dont want ichance enjoyers int w me, then thank u!! 
ive been harassed/pressured into liking the ship, my boundaries have been pushed by random people and even my friends and im so sick and tired of it so i made this.

# CANON LORE
so based off the canon lore, im not gonna beat around the bush, itrapped kills chance.
we dont know if he feels remorse, but all we do know is that itrapped USED him to get the key to the banlands and a key to open a vault with lots of money
chance had no genuine friends, so he hung onto itrapped.
chance was lonely and desperate, and itrapped took advantage of that.
emphasis on advantange.
its canon itrapped never saw anything in chance other than a quick way to make money.
itrapped grew impatient and killed chance.

# PERSONAL THOUGHTS
okay, now thats canon.
i dont see any romantic intention between the two.
itrapped took advantage, used, manipulated, and betrayed.
is that how you love someone??
i dont think so.
it was a toxic friendship that itrapped wanted control over only for his own benefit.
i dont get how people find that "loving" or whatever you want to call it.
its a comship.
a comship is when two individuals are in a toxic relationship with one another, a complicated ship
itrapped wanted him dead, not alive, not near him, just dead, gone, and away.
chance didnt feel that way, he thought he was a friend.
he was vulnerable which itrapped took advantage of.
if you ship this, you're a comshipper.
its manipulator x victim.
just seeing the ship makes me sick to my stomach to the point just mentioned of it became a trigger.
no, im not joking. call me sensitive, but just seeing fanart of it made me have a panic attack.
im an itrapped fan, so i search up itrapped everywhere
i am bound to see ichance obviously, so dont just tell me 'just block them' because ive already BEEN doing that
this isnt meant to hate on ichance lovers, im just stating the facts and i hate how normalized this ship is.
toxic ships are everywhere, sure, but when i see my COMFORT CHARACTER encouraging another character into self harm.
thats when things draw a line.
yes, theres actual fanart of it.

# DONT DO THESE.
mention ichance (unless ure saying u hate it)
why? it makes me uncomfortable
ask me 'if u hate ichance, then why do u like itrapped??'
reason is, i first got into itrapped for the psychology of manipulators and their intent, which eventually made me like mm2012 itrapped and neutral abt- 
-forsaken itrapped
force me to like it.
why? because facts wont ever change, they are FACTS.
harass me
why? i dont harass ichance enjoyers, i think that says enough
